======================
Django Forum TODO List
======================

:author: Jonathan Buchanan

Top Priority
============

*Dirty hacks and other broken windows.*

Implement At Will
=================

*Features, fixes and tasks which are ready to be implementated or performed as
and when the time can be found.*

- Standalone mode issues which will need to be resolved:

  - Provide a means of performing certain URL lookups based on whether we're in
    standalone mode or not. There's already a ``LOGIN_URL`` setting which we
    could use instead of django-registration's ``auth_login`` named URL, but
    what about the logout and register URLs?
    
- Testing in non-standalone mode:

  - Create a project which itself uses django-registration to ensure that the
    forum's set of templates don't take precedence. If the order of
    ``INSTALLED_APPS`` is important in this case, document it in the
    installation docs.
  - I imagine it will be likely that the forum's standalone password
    change/reset forms will be used in favour of the admin application's any
    time a project is using the application directory template loader (as we
    require it to) - it might be necessary to add moving of the standalone
    registration templates into the ``/forum/templates/`` directory as one of
    the installation steps for using the forum in standalone mode.

- Verify that the post formatting module specified looks like it contains
  everything a post formatting module should provide.
- Create quick and full help templates for the provided post formatters.
- Give the BBCode formatter some love - we're currently using the default set of
  tags it provides. Decide which we really need, which are missing and implement
  them if need be.

*Testing.*

- Write test client tests.

For Future Consideration
========================

*Features which require a bit more consideration - as in does the application
really need the added complexity they bring? It has a very simple structure at
the moment.*

- Top-level forum groups, with ordering defined per group.
- Subforums.
- Tracking the topics a user has viewed and when they last viewed them.
- Tracking which posts were replied to / using this information to offer a
  threaded topic view.
