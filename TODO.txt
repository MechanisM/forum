Django Forum TODO List
======================

:author: Jonathan Buchanan

Top Priority
============

*Dirty hacks and other broken windows.*

Make It So, Number One
======================

*Features, fixes and tasks which are ready to be implementated or performed as
and when the time can be found.*

- Non-standalone mode issues which will need to be resolved:

  - Provide a means of performing certain URL lookups based on whether we're in
    standalone mode or not. There's already a ``LOGIN_URL`` setting which we
    could use instead of django-registration's ``auth_login`` named URL, but
    what about the logout and register URLs?
  - I imagine it will be likely that the forum's standalone password
    change/reset forms will be used in favour of the admin application's any
    time a project is using the application directory template loader (as we
    require it to) - it might be necessary to add moving of the standalone
    registration templates into the ``/forum/templates/`` directory as one of
    the installation steps for using the forum in standalone mode.

- Basic searching.
- Create full help templates for the provided post formatters.
- Give the BBCode formatter some love - we're currently using the default set of
  tags it provides. Decide which we really need, which are missing and implement
  them if need be.
- Post control for moderators - move post to another topic, merge all posts from
  one topic into another.
- User control for moderators.

*Testing.*

- Write test client tests.
- Testing in non-standalone mode - create a project which itself uses
  django-registration to ensure that the forum's set of templates don't take
  precedence. If the order of ``INSTALLED_APPS`` is important in this case,
  document it in the installation docs.

For Future Consideration
========================

*Features which require a bit more consideration - as in does the application
really need the added complexity they bring? It has a fairly simple structure
at the moment.*

*Boring stuff which most forums have:*

- Subforums.
- Tracking which posts were replied to / using this information to offer a
  threaded topic view.
- Poll topics.

*Possibly less boring stuff:*

- Up/down voting *everywhere*, starting with users, topics and posts, each of
  which should have a configurable lower boundary in user profiles, scores under
  which would result in topics, posts or everything from given users being
  hidden. Let consensus be your ignore list, if you're mad enough.
- Forum Types, which could affect how everything in a particular forum works.
  Examples:

  - Help Forums could have the initial post in each topic displayed on every
    page, with some kind of kudos point system in place, where topic starters
    can award points for useful answers. Uses of kudos points:

    1. Total points earned could be displayed in place of Postcounts in user
       profiles, and they would actually *mean* something.
    2. An option to view only the starting post and posts which got kudos points
       if you just want to see what the useful answers were.

- Progressive enhancement with JavaScript:

  - Hijack topic and forum pagination.
  - Hijack posting of new replies to work on the same page.
  - Periodic fetching of new posts when on the last page of a topic.
  - Adding a new control to edit replies in place, with preview.
