======================
Django Forum TODO List
======================

:author: Jonathan Buchanan

Top Priority
============

Dirty hacks and other broken windows.

- Fix the awful, dirty hack in ``forum.views.redirect_to_post`` - manual post
  numbering via another denormalised field is looking like the easiest option at
  the moment.

Implement At Will
=================

Features and fixes which are ready for implementation as and when the time can
be found.

- Navigation / forum and topic breadcrumbs.
- Tidy HTML where appropriate - for example, there are currently a lot of
  redundant ``<dt>`` elements in the user profiles displayed next to posts
  (which are being hidden using CSS), while the labels they contain are being
  doubled up in the corresponding ``<dd>`` elements - yuck!
- Validation of avatars:

  - Simple URL filename check.
  - Restrict based on their dimensions (loading images with PIL) or simply force
    them to appear at a certain size as a quick fix.

- Add a method to post formatting modules for display of help text on post
  forms.
- Give the BBCode formatter some love - we're currently using the default set of
  tags it provides. Decide which we really need, which are missing and implement
  them if need be.

For Future Consideration
========================

Features which require a bit more consideration - as in does the application
*really* need the added complexity they bring? It has a very simple structure at
the moment.

- Forum groups with ordering defined per group
- Subforums
- Tracking the posts a user has viewed and when they last viewed them.
- Tracking which posts were replied to / offering a threaded view for topics.
