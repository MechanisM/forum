======================
Django Forum TODO List
======================

:author: Jonathan Buchanan

Top Priority
============

*Dirty hacks and other broken windows.*

Implement At Will
=================

*Features, fixes and tasks which are ready to be implementated or performed as
and when the time can be found.*

- Navigation / forum and topic breadcrumbs.
- Topic deletion.
- Testing in non-standalone mode:

  - Create a project which itself uses django-registration to ensure that the
    forum's set of templates don't take precedence. If the order of
    ``INSTALLED_APPS`` is important in this case, document it in the
    installation docs.
  - I imagine it will be likely that the forum's standalone password
    change/reset forms will be used in favour of the admin application's any
    time a project is using the application directory template loader (as we
    require it to) - it might be necessary to add moving of the standalone
    registration templates into the ``/forum/templates/`` directory as one of
    the installation steps for using the forum in standalone mode.

- Validation of avatars:

  - Simple URL filename check.
  - Restrict based on their dimensions (loading images with PIL) or simply force
    them to appear at a certain size as a quick fix.

- Add a method to post formatting modules for display of help text on post
  forms.
- Give the BBCode formatter some love - we're currently using the default set of
  tags it provides. Decide which we really need, which are missing and implement
  them if need be.

For Future Consideration
========================

*Features which require a bit more consideration - as in does the application
really need the added complexity they bring? It has a very simple structure at
the moment.*

- Forum groups with ordering defined per group
- Subforums
- Tracking the posts a user has viewed and when they last viewed them.
- Tracking which posts were replied to / offering a threaded view for topics.
